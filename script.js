// Form validation, the process of ensuring a user's answers to a form are correct, complete, and fit within
// some specific criteria (e.g. a password having containing a number or special character), is a VERY
// important part of being a fullstack developer as it helps prevent errors, improve data accuracy, and ensures
// that no data is missing upon form completion

// Your assignment is to do the following:
// 1. Write a function called validateForm(e) where e is an 'event' variable (this is default
//    behavior for forms - feel free to call it 'event' as well)
// 2. Inside of validateForm(e), get the information of the form fields by either using querySelectors
//    or by traversing the event object and do the following checks:
//      2a. If the #name input element is empty, send an alert telling the user to enter their name
//          using the alert() method and then return false
//      2b. If the #email input element doesn't have a '@' in it, send an alert to tell them to enter
//          a proper email and then return false
//      2c. If the #password input element is empty, send an alert telling the user to enter a password
//          and return false
//      2d. If the #password input element is less than 8 characters, send an alert telling the user
//          their password must be at least 8 characters and then return false
// 3. If all of the checks pass, return true
// 4. Lastly, add an event listener onto the form (id="#userForm") that waits for
//    a 'submit' event and runs the validateForm callback function when that event happens

//Hint: When dealing with a form submission that takes an event variable as a parameter, use e.preventDefault()
//      (or event.preventDefault() depending on the name of the variable) to prevent the page
//      from refreshing when a form is submitted. Do all your checks after that line.

let form = document.querySelector('#userForm');
form.addEventListener("submit", validateForm);

function validateForm(e) {
    e.preventDefault();

    let name = e.target.name.value;
    let email= e.target.email.value;
    let password = e.target.password.value;

    //Validate name
    if (name === "") {
        alert('Please enter your name');
        return false;
    }

    //Validate email
    if (email.indexOf("@") === -1) {
        alert('Please enter a valid email address');
        return false;
    }

    //Validate password
    if (password === "") {
        alert('Please enter a password');
        return false;
    } else if (password.length < 8) {
        alert('Password must be at least 8 characters. Please enter a new password.');
        return false;
    }

    return true;
}
